            <h2>Pylint:</h2>
            <p>What is Pylint -
                Pylint is a tool to check Python’s code errors enforcing some code standards. It looks for certain types
                of errors and recommends suggestions about how particular chunks of code can be refactored. The Python
                community has formalized some recommended programming styles to help everyone write code in a common,
                agreed-upon style that makes the most sense for shared code. This style is captured in PEP 8, “the style
                guide for Python code”. Pylint can be a quick and easy way of seeing if your code has captured the
                pattern of PEP 8 standards and is user-friendly
                It displays the number of messages as it analyzes the code and it can also be used for displaying some
                statistics about the number of warnings and errors found in different files. It gives overall marks to
                the code based on the number and severity of the warnings and errors.
                We should have .pylintrc which is the config file for pylint.

                We will make a small tutorial for one part of calculator code to check if that passes the pylint
                standards or not.
            </p>
            <h2>Tutorial</h2>
            <img src="../images/pylintTutorial1.jpg" alt="pylintTutorial1">
            <p>So this is our code ‘main.py’ for the calculator program. Let’s see what we get when we run through
                pylint. Pylint also gives marks to your code.<br>

                Command - ‘pylint filename’. We have a main.py file in folder named calculator.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/pylintTutorial2.jpg" alt="pylintTutorial2">
            <p>We see we got three error messages. First one says it’s on line 2 and the other two are on line 21. Two
                of them are about missing class and function docstring. So there should be a little comment underneath
                explaining the class ‘calculator’ and method ‘divide_number’ does. Middle one is about that method name
                does not follow snake_case naming style. There should be no capital letters in the method name. Let’s
                correct them and run it.
            </p>
            <h4>Here is the updated code:</h4>

            <p>Let’s see what we get after running it</p>

            <p><b>Hooray!!</b> No errors and we got full marks.</p>
