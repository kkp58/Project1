            <h3>What is Packet Switching?</h3>
            <p>Chopping the data into little pieces called packets, launching them into the network and it tries to find
                its way to its destination, each packet operating independently. The packet switching method is very
                reliable and allows data to be sent securely, even over damaged networks; it also uses bandwidth very
                efficiently and doesn’t need a single dedicated link, like a telephone call does. Paul Baran came up
                with this idea of hot potato routing. Hot Potato routing meant a message transiting a network goes where
                it should be going, even if part of the network was destroyed. He got this idea from previous model of
                mice in a maze</p>

            <h3>How TCP/IP works?</h3>
            <p>TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The term is used to describe a set of
                protocols that govern how data moves through a network. All the different devices on the internet have
                unique addresses. An address on the internet is just a number similar to a phone number, or a sort of
                street address that's unique to each computer or device at the edge of the network. And it forms part of
                one of the most important protocols used in internet communication, simply called IP. A computer's
                address then is called its IP address. Visiting website is really just your computer
                asking another computer for information. Your computer sends a message to the other computer's IP
                address, and it also sends along its origin address so the other computer knows where to send its
                response </p>

            <h3>What does the DNS do?</h3>
            <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is the internet’s equivalent of a phone book, and converts
                hard-to-remember IP addresses into simple names. Most users never see or care about internet addresses.
                A system called the domain name system or DNS associates names like www.example.com with the
                corresponding addresses. Your computer uses DNS to look up the domain names and get’s that associated IP
                address which is then used to connect your computer to the destination. </p>

            <h3>HTTP and HTML</h3>
            <p>So you've probably wondered what actually happens when you type an address into your web browser and then
                hit enter. So in that moment, your computer starts
                talking to another computer called a server, that is usually 1000s of miles away. And in milliseconds,
                your computer asks that server for a website. That server then starts to talk back to your computer in a
                language called HTTP. An HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. You can kind of think of it
                as the language that one computer uses to ask another computer for a document. The HTML stands for
                Hypertext Markup Language and that is the language that you use to tell a web browser
                how to make a page look. To summarize, HTTP and DNS manage the sending and receiving of HTML, media
                files or anything on the web. What makes this possible under the hood are TCP/IP and router networks
                that break down and transport information in small packets. Those packets themselves are made up of
                binary sequences of ones and zeros that are physically sent through electric wires, fiber optic cables
                and wireless networks.
