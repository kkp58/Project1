        <p>
            The origins of the internet are rooted in the USA of the 1950s. The Cold War was at its height and huge
            tensions existed between North America and the Soviet Union. Both superpowers were in possession of deadly
            nuclear weapons, and people lived in fear of long-range surprise attacks. The US realised it needed a
            communications system that could not be affected by a Soviet nuclear attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this time, computers were large, expensive machines exclusively used by military scientists and
            university staff.
            These machines were powerful but limited in numbers, and researchers grew increasingly frustrated: they
            required access to the technology, but had to travel great distances to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve this problem, researchers started ‘time-sharing’. This meant that users could simultaneously access
            a mainframe computer through a series of terminals, although individually they had only a fraction of the
            computer’s actual power at their command.
            The difficulty of using such systems led various scientists, engineers and organisations to research the
            possibility of a large-scale computer network.
        </p>
        <p>Originally phone lines were the only data communication by AT&T’s monopoly. But the four-year old
            Advanced
            Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense, a future-oriented funder of
            ‘high-risk,
            high-gain’ research, lays the groundwork for what becomes the ARPANET and lays the foundation of what we
            call an ‘Internet’ today</p>
        <p>By 1992, when this timeline ends,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the Internet has one million hosts</li>
            <li>the ARPANET has ceased to exist</li>
            <li>computers are nine orders of magnitude faster</li>
            <li>network bandwidth is twenty million times greater</li>
